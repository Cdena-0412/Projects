# Sentiment Analysis Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`Sentimentanalysismodel.ipynb`) implements a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. It processes text data to determine the sentiment of given inputs, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning and tokenization)
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.)
- Model training (using classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning models)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
```

Additional dependencies may be required depending on the model used.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess the text.
3. Train the sentiment analysis model.
4. Evaluate and interpret the modelâ€™s performance.
5. Use the trained model for sentiment prediction.

## Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset containing text samples with labeled sentiment values. Modify the data-loading section accordingly.

## Output
The notebook generates:
- Model accuracy scores
- Confusion matrix
- Sentiment predictions for test data
